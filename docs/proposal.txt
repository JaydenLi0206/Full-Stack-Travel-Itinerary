Idea 1 - Travel Itinerary Generator:
This web application is a personalized tool that uses a decoupled architecture with a front-end and back-end communicating via a RESTful API interface. It incorporates
at least two publicly available data sets via API, such as the Google Places API, the OpenWeatherMap API, or the Yelp Fusion API, to generate a travel itinerary based on
a user's personal interests and hobbies. The application requires users to log in via OAuth authentication with a Google or Facebook account and stores their profile
information in a database, which acts as a cache for data retrieved from third-party APIs. The back-end server retrieves data from the database and third-party APIs to
generate a travel itinerary that includes details such as art museums, recommended restaurants, weather forecasts, and events or conferences. The front-end displays the
itinerary to the user and allows them to modify or save it for future reference. The application provides users with a comprehensive and personalized travel planning
experience that helps them plan a trip that aligns with their unique preferences and interests.

Idea 2 - Pet Adoption App:
This application aims to build a web-based application that connects potential pet adopters with pets that need homes. The app will allow users to search for pets based
on their location, preferences, previous adoption history, and other relevant factors. By using this consistently, users can adopt a pet and bring more joy to their
lives. We could store users information and petsâ€™ adoption history into a non-relational database such as MongoDB. The app will utilize the Petfinder API and Google Maps
API to suggest pets for adoption based on the user's location and preferences. The application requires users to log in via OAuth authentication with third-party
authentication services, such as Google or Facebook, to provide a secure and convenient login experience for users.  It also uses a decoupled architecture with a
front-end and back-end communicating via a RESTful API interface. Backend could get data from our database and third-party APIs, and frontend will display the list of
available pets for the users based on their preferences. Overall, this app will provide a platform for pet adoption agencies to reach potential adopters and increase the
visibility of the pets available for adoption.
