As a user of the itinerary app, I want to be able to create an itinerary not only based on my interests and location, but also for how many days I will be on the trip
for. Because I donâ€™t want to be bored during the trip, I want the itinerary to provide enough things to do to keep me entertained the whole time. When I open the app, I
want to be able to navigate to the trip planning section and select the option to set the duration of my trip. I expect to be able to input the start and end dates of my
trip, as well as the number of days that I will be traveling.
