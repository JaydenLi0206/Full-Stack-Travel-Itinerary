As a user of the itinerary travel application, I want to be able to log into my account and use the application using my personal information. I want to use the app in a
personal way where modifications and changes that I make within the app is saved and I can come back to it by login back into my account. As a frequent traveler, I want
to be able to access my personalized travel itinerary on-the-go through an app. In order to do so, I need to be able to log in securely and quickly to the app from my
mobile device. When I open the app, I want to be presented with a clear and simple login page. I should be able to enter my email address and password, or use a social
media login option such as Google or Facebook. If I forget my password, I would like to be able to easily reset it by clicking on a "forgot password" link on the login
page. Once I successfully log in, I want to be taken directly to my personalized itinerary page, which should display all of my upcoming trips and relevant travel
information, such as flight details, hotel reservations, and transportation schedules.
